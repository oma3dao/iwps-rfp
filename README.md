The Portaling and Mapping Working Group was the first active working group at OMA3.  Last July we released a position paper on the Inter World Portaling System (IWPS).  This is a request for proposals (RFP).  We are requesting a wide variety of proposals from the community to get as many designs as possible.  If you’ve worked on a virtual world teleportation project before we’d like you to join OMA3 and propose something.  A proposal can address just a small component of IWPS, or the whole system.  We are looking specifically for the following solutions:

Protocols for enabling teleportation between virtual worlds
APIs to integrate third party identity services, payment services, and messaging systems
Asset transfer bridging and verification protocols
On and off chain data privacy
  
We will evaluate all proposals in the working group and come up with a draft specification. Once we do, we will finally release an RFC to the public.  So, please read this RFP and join the process.

Please comment on the paper by [creating an issue](https://github.com/oma3dao/iwps-rfp/issues/new) or commenting in the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m6lUNzhqJGCLUPqH_8g3wOP0eiYmZWBj7LGVb_BGE9s/).
